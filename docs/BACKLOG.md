# Backlog — known defects, not scheduled

Defects found while working through the v3.0.0 library extraction and the raids after it, each with
a traced cause rather than a guess. This file exists so the diagnosis is not redone from scratch.

Companion to `REVIEW-DECISIONS.md`, which records findings deliberately **not** changed. This file
records findings that *should* change, eventually. An entry is deleted once it is fixed — the code
and its comments carry the diagnosis from then on, and `git log --grep=Bnn` finds the commit.

**2026-07-27:** B1 (shift-clicked items) and B5 (small close button) were fixed and removed.

**2026-07-28:** B2 (the font setting not reaching some widgets) was removed. Its Loot Council and
Loot History halves were fixed; the remaining half — the sidebar tabs and the Language/Accent
Colour/Reset Defaults/Profile buttons — was measured in-game and does not reproduce. Wrapping
`ApplyStyle` showed it receiving the newly chosen font path on every dropdown click, and comparing
`GetFont()` across the whole `buttonTexts` registry under a deliberately distinctive font returned
zero widgets differing from the reference. Do not re-open without a fresh reproduction.

**2026-07-28:** B4 (the minimap toggle leaving the button behind) was fixed and removed. The cause
was not the `Show`/`Hide` pair it was filed against: LibDBIcon keeps its own `hide` flag inside the
saved table it is registered with, and both `Register` and `Refresh` decide visibility from that flag
alone. KART never wrote it, so the `Refresh` call at the end of `KART.UpdateMinimapButton` undid the
`Hide` two lines above it, and every login re-showed the icon regardless of the checkbox.

Ruled out while diagnosing, and worth not re-deriving: the *invisible but still clickable* button
reported alongside this is `EllesmereUIMinimap`, which reparents every LibDBIcon button into a flyout
panel and holds it at alpha 0 while that panel is collapsed. Not a KART defect, and not fixable from
our side.

**2026-07-28:** B8 (Blizzard confirm dialogs buried under KART windows) was fixed and removed.
`RegisterStaticPopup` now lifts the popup frame on show and restores it on hide. It lifts to
`TOOLTIP` rather than `GetDialogStrata()` on purpose: the Loot Council windows carry their own
stratum setting since B22, so one-above-the-shared-setting would still land under them.

**2026-07-28:** everything else that was still open — B3, B6, B7, B9 through B22, and B24 through
B28 — was fixed for the 3.1.0 release and removed. Each fix names its number in the commit subject
or body.

**2026-07-29:** B23 (button borders incomplete at 1080p) was fixed and removed, confirmed in-game by
the reporter. The border *width* is snapped to whole physical pixels; child *positions* are not, so
on a client whose UI scale does not match its resolution an edge can still read as soft rather than
broken. That limitation was stated in GitHub issue #5 when it was closed.

**2026-07-29:** a five-agent read-only review swept the whole Loot Council after one raid evening
turned up three defects. Everything it found is below, ordered by what it costs the raid rather than
by where it lives. Five entries were fixed the same evening and never got a number: the locked
Lootmaster field, the session prompt ending a live session, two bare `IsInRaid()` calls, the latched
lootmaster-clash warning, and `StartTest` missing `equipRequestedRolls`.

Entries marked **[opt-in]** can only fire while `lcHideIrrelevant` or `lcAutoTransmogVote` is on.
Both default to off, so an untouched install is not exposed to them.

# Tier A — the loot flow stops for the whole raid

B29 to B33 share one root: ownership and session state are distributed across clients with no single
authoritative holder. They want one design pass, not five patches.

## B29 — a departed lootmaster leaves the raid with no loot owner

`LC.raidConfig.lootmaster` is written only by `TryAcceptConfig`/`ApplyOwnConfig` and never
invalidated; neither `TearDownForRaidExit` nor `ClearAllRolls` touch it, and nothing prunes it on a
roster change. When the named lootmaster disconnects, `GetLootmaster()` still returns their key, so
`IsLootOwner()` is false for everybody — the `UnitIsGroupLeader` fallback is unreachable while the
string is non-empty. Nobody force-wins, nobody broadcasts `LC_START`, and the session cannot be ended
by anyone. `raidConfig` survives leaving the raid, so the same client is still stuck in the next one.

Partially mitigated 2026-07-29: the Lootmaster field is editable again once the configured owner is
absent, so a replacement can name themselves. The stale key itself is still never invalidated.

## B30 — a reloaded loot owner is answered by nobody, and their session stays off

`LC.HandleStateRequest` replies only if `LC.IsLootOwner()`. After the lootmaster reloads their own
`sessionActive` is false and they send `LC_STATE_REQ`; on every peer the loot owner resolves to the
reloading player, so no peer replies. The raid still believes the session runs while the one client
that must win the items has it off: `OnStartLootRoll` returns early, so no force-win, no `LC_START`,
no vote windows anywhere, while Auto-Pass raiders keep passing. Workaround until fixed: toggle the
session by hand after every reload.

## B31 — post-reload recovery hangs on an event that may never come again

`LC.CheckRaidJoin` is wired to `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` only. `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` is registered and
handled but never calls it. If the roster event after a reload arrives while `GetNumGroupMembers()`
is still 0, the exit-confirm branch runs and returns; the re-check a few seconds later sees the raid
again and returns without ever running the in-raid branch. With a static roster nothing else fires,
so `LC_STATE_REQ`, the loot-history catch-up and the session prompt are all skipped. Compounds B30.

## B32 — handing the lootmaster role over broadcasts nothing

Typing a successor's name makes `IsConfigOwner()` false on the outgoing owner's own client, so
`ApplyOwnConfig` wipes `raidConfig` and `CouncilNamesTable` and returns, and `BroadcastRaidConfig`
returns without sending. Peers still name the outgoing owner; the successor's own field does not name
them either. Lands straight in B29.

## B33 — an empty Lootmaster field means no config owner at all

`IsConfigOwner()` reads `KART_Settings.lcLootmaster` directly, so an empty field — an explicitly
supported setup per `LC_SET_LOOTMASTER_HINT` — means `ApplyOwnConfig` and `BroadcastRaidConfig` both
return early. `LC.CouncilNamesTable` stays empty on every client, so every listed council member gets
no panel all night, and every client falls back to its own button labels: the B25 vote-label mismatch
by another route. The role-status label meanwhile reports that all is well.

# Tier B — an item is lost or awarded wrongly, silently

## B34 — a reload mid-roll loses the item entirely

Only `KART_LCTrades` and `KART_LootHistory` are SavedVariables, and `Trade.RestorePersistedTrades`
only rehydrates decided trades. Everything about an undecided roll — item link, votes, deadlines,
tabs — is in memory only. The lootmaster force-wins a Bind-on-Pickup item, reloads before the council
assigns, and `START_LOOT_ROLL` will not fire again: they hold a real item that no client, no saved
variable and no window still associates with a roll.

## B35 — two council members can award the same item at the same time

Assigning is deliberately open to the whole council, and `Trade.AssignWinner`'s only double-assign
guard reads `LC.assignedWinners[rollID]` locally. Addon messages never echo to their sender, so two
assigners each see nil, each broadcast, and each overwrite the other's record on receipt. Both clients
end up permanently disagreeing about the winner, and what actually gets traded is whichever message
reached the lootmaster last.

## B36 — "irrelevant" is far wider than the setting claims **[opt-in]**

`irrelevant = not canNeed` treats every reason Blizzard disables Need as "your class cannot equip
this": wrong loot specialization, level requirement, unique-equipped. `reasonNeed` sits in the same
return and is discarded. A Holy Paladin with hiding on never sees a strength plate chest they would
have taken for off-spec — the exact case the feature was designed to keep visible (GitHub issue #11).
The same expression turns an unknown `canNeed` into "irrelevant", which the file's own header forbids;
`needsAppearance` on the same line resolves unknown the safe way.

## B37 — the relevance snapshot outlives the roll it describes **[opt-in]**

`Trade.ClearRollState` deliberately keeps `relevanceSnapshot`, arguing the relevance frame has already
snapshotted the new item. That holds for the `LC.OnStartLootRoll` caller and not for `LC.HandleStart`,
which exists precisely for clients that got no local `START_LOOT_ROLL`. A raider who was dead for the
reused rollID gets the previous item's verdict applied to the new one — a best-in-slot piece
auto-passed without ever being drawn.

## B38 — the snapshot records no item identity, and is written for rolls Council ignores **[opt-in]**

The `START_LOOT_ROLL` handler has no `councilEngages` gate, and `LC.OnStartLootRoll` returns before
`PurgeStaleRoll` for rolls Council does not engage. So a trash Bind-on-Equip drop or collectible
reusing a live rollID silently rewrites the snapshot of the item currently being voted on, and nothing
purges it. Those are exactly the items trash drops constantly.

## B39 — the appearance fallback answers the wrong question **[opt-in]**

`NeedsAppearance`'s non-snapshot path asks "do I already own this appearance", never "can I collect
it": the sourceID from `C_TransmogCollection.GetItemInfo` is discarded and `PlayerCanCollectSource` is
never called. It is consulted only for items the player cannot equip — the population where the two
questions diverge — so it can broadcast a Transmog vote on an appearance that character can never
learn, and the council may award the item on the strength of it.

---

# Tier C — one player drops out of the round

## B40 — a "???" item link permanently blinds the reused-rollID detector

`LC.HandleStart` builds the link only from `GetLootRollItemLink`, which returns nil for a dead or
out-of-range client, and `ResolveRollItemLink` retries the same nil-returning API and gives up — even
though the `LC_START` payload carried the itemID, which the code parses and then never uses to rebuild
a link (`Trade.HandleResult` performs exactly that rebuild). `"???"` fails `IsRealItemLink`, so
`PurgeStaleRoll` bails for the rest of the session and every per-roll table survives into the next
item: the raider's row shows an old vote and they can never vote again.

## B41 — the voted-items filter removes the row the correction lives on **[opt-in]**

`Vote.GetVisibleRolls` tests `LC.votedByMe[rollID]` raw, without the `not isAuto` exemption both row
renderers apply. With "voted item display = hide" an auto-cast Transmog vote removes its own row on the
next refresh, so the hint "click any response to change it" points at a button that is not on screen —
and unticking the hide setting does not bring an auto-passed row back either, contrary to the guarantee
stated in that function.

## B42 — snapshots are swept before the vote row they belong to exists **[opt-in]**

The self-sweep protects `rollID` itself and entries in `LC.voteListRolls`, but on a non-lootmaster
client a roll only enters that list when `LC_START` arrives — one round trip after the local
`START_LOOT_ROLL`, by which time Auto-Pass has blanked `GetLootRollItemInfo`. On a multi-item boss each
roll's snapshot is deleted while handling the next one, so only the last item keeps Blizzard's verdict
and the rest fall through to the armor rule, which answers nil for weapons and jewellery.

---

# Tier D — the wrong thing is displayed

## B43 — the vote-count guard is length-only

`voteData.count` catches a change in the number of buttons, not a same-length rename or reorder. The
config owner editing labels mid-roll pushes the new set live, and votes cast before the edit are then
rendered under whatever the label became, with no "unknown" fallback.

## B44 — the council tab tooltip skips the guard entirely

It resolves `buttons[tonumber(voteData.idx)]` without reading `voteData.count`, so it states a label
with full confidence for the same vote the row list below it correctly renders as "?".

## B45 — the voter's own badge has no guard at all

`votedDef` is resolved against whatever `GetButtonConfig()` returns right now, with no stored count.
After a mid-roll label edit the raider is told they voted something they did not.

## B46 — a late vote is accepted onto a reused rollID

`Vote.HandleVote` and `Vote.HandleCouncilVote` check only that *some* item is tracked under the rollID,
not that it is the same one. A network-delayed vote for the previous item lands in the new item's tally.

---

# Tier E — cleanup, cosmetics, narrow triggers

## B47 — expired pending trades are pruned only by a reload

`Trade.CheckTradeTimeouts` warns and never removes; the only pruning happens in
`Trade.RestorePersistedTrades` at `ADDON_LOADED`. Hours past Blizzard's real trade window, dead entries
still sit in the reminder list, indistinguishable from live ones.

## B48 — a self-assigning council member gets no reminder

`LC.owedToMe` is populated only in `Trade.HandleResult`, i.e. only on a client that *received* the
broadcast. A council member who assigns an item to themselves never processes their own message and so
never gets their own "you are owed this" entry, though the lootmaster's queue is correct.

## B49 — hiding every row stops the pruner **[opt-in]**

The window hides when `GetVisibleRolls` comes back empty, and `OnHide` cancels the ticker that is the
only thing calling `Vote.PruneExpiredRolls` during a batch. The rolls never expire and never reach
`Trade.ClearRollState`; `/kart showall` later reopens long-dead rolls with live vote buttons.

## B50 — `relevanceHandled` ignores the settings that produced the answer **[opt-in]**

The latch is permanent per roll, so ticking the other switch mid-batch does nothing for rolls already
answered — the setting appears inert and the broadcast Pass stands.

## B51 — `/kart lc` shows frozen hidden rows **[opt-in]**

That path calls `voteListFrame:Show()` directly with no refresh, so the pool still holds the last drawn
layout: a window full of items the player was told were hidden, with stopped countdowns, until the
ticker's first prune hides it again.

## B52 — an accepted config does not repaint an open council panel

`LC.HandleConfig` omits the `RefreshCouncilPanelIfOpen()` call its own retry path makes, so a council
member keeps seeing votes under the old label set until some unrelated event refreshes the rows.

## B53 — a legacy note beginning with a hash and digits is misparsed

`ParseVotePayload`'s count disambiguator can match a pre-3.1 client's note, truncating it and
fabricating a count the sender never sent — which then either wrongly trips or wrongly satisfies the
mismatch check.

## B54 — auto-answers rebuild the window once per roll, nested **[opt-in]**

`ApplyToPendingRolls` runs at the top of `RefreshVoteListRows`, and `CastVote` ends in
`RefreshVoteListRows`, so N simultaneous auto-answered drops produce N nested full rebuilds in one
frame. Bounded and correct, but a visible hitch exactly when the window first appears.
