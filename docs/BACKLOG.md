# Backlog — known defects, not scheduled

Defects found while working through the v3.0.0 library extraction and the raids after it, each with
a traced cause rather than a guess. This file exists so the diagnosis is not redone from scratch.

Companion to `REVIEW-DECISIONS.md`, which records findings deliberately **not** changed. This file
records findings that *should* change, eventually. An entry is deleted once it is fixed — the code
and its comments carry the diagnosis from then on, and `git log --grep=Bnn` finds the commit.

**2026-07-27:** B1 (shift-clicked items) and B5 (small close button) were fixed and removed.

**2026-07-28:** B2 (the font setting not reaching some widgets) was removed. Its Loot Council and
Loot History halves were fixed; the remaining half — the sidebar tabs and the Language/Accent
Colour/Reset Defaults/Profile buttons — was measured in-game and does not reproduce. Wrapping
`ApplyStyle` showed it receiving the newly chosen font path on every dropdown click, and comparing
`GetFont()` across the whole `buttonTexts` registry under a deliberately distinctive font returned
zero widgets differing from the reference. Do not re-open without a fresh reproduction.

**2026-07-28:** B4 (the minimap toggle leaving the button behind) was fixed and removed. The cause
was not the `Show`/`Hide` pair it was filed against: LibDBIcon keeps its own `hide` flag inside the
saved table it is registered with, and both `Register` and `Refresh` decide visibility from that flag
alone. KART never wrote it, so the `Refresh` call at the end of `KART.UpdateMinimapButton` undid the
`Hide` two lines above it, and every login re-showed the icon regardless of the checkbox.

Ruled out while diagnosing, and worth not re-deriving: the *invisible but still clickable* button
reported alongside this is `EllesmereUIMinimap`, which reparents every LibDBIcon button into a flyout
panel and holds it at alpha 0 while that panel is collapsed. Not a KART defect, and not fixable from
our side.

**2026-07-28:** B8 (Blizzard confirm dialogs buried under KART windows) was fixed and removed.
`RegisterStaticPopup` now lifts the popup frame on show and restores it on hide. It lifts to
`TOOLTIP` rather than `GetDialogStrata()` on purpose: the Loot Council windows carry their own
stratum setting since B22, so one-above-the-shared-setting would still land under them.

**2026-07-28:** everything else that was still open — B3, B6, B7, B9 through B22, and B24 through
B28 — was fixed for the 3.1.0 release and removed. Each fix names its number in the commit subject
or body.

**2026-07-29:** B23 (button borders incomplete at 1080p) was fixed and removed, confirmed in-game by
the reporter. The border *width* is snapped to whole physical pixels; child *positions* are not, so
on a client whose UI scale does not match its resolution an edge can still read as soft rather than
broken. That limitation was stated in GitHub issue #5 when it was closed.

Nothing is currently open.
